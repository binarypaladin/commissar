# Commissar

A simple authorization framework named for authoritarian gentlemen who really, _really_ care about rules and paperwork.

Also, I'm a huge fun of the Warhammer 40K universe and prefer using names that [inspire morale and confidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EirpwFWSBfU).

See the module documentation for more details.

## Installation

This isn't available in Hex yet. I'm using it on some personal projects while I smooth out the API. If you want to try it out anyway:

You can add the package to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs` like so:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:commissar, git:  "binarypaladin/commissar", branch: "master"}
  ]
end
```
